====
A JSON Annotated Music Specification for Reproducible MIR Research.

JAMS provides:
    * A formal JSON schema for generic annotations
    * The ability to store multiple annotations per file
    * Schema definitions for a wide range of annotation types (beats, chords, segments, tags, etc.)
    * Error detection and validation
    * A translation layer to interface with `mir_eval <https://craffel.github.io/mir_eval>`_ for evaluating annotations
